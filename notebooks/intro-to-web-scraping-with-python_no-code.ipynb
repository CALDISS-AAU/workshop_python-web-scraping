    "\n",
    "This requires some knowledge of what HTML is and how it is structured.\n",

    "HTML is short for \"Hyper-Text Markup Language\". It is used on webpages to give the pages their structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is structured in \"tags\" denoted by `<>` and `</>`. The tags denote what kind of content it is. `<p>` is for example a paragraph tag. A piece of HTML like: `<p> This is a paragraph </p>` will render the sentence \"This is a paragraph\" as a paragraph. Common tags include `h1` for headings (and `h2`, `h3` and so on), `a` for links and `div` for a \"division\" or \"section\".\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is structured in a tree-like structure. Tags are therefore usually located within other tags. Tags on the same level are refered to as \"siblings\", tags inside other tags are refered to as \"children\" and tags outside other tags are refered to as \"parents\".\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML uses \"attributes\" to both differentiate between the same type of tags and to add other variables/information to the tag. The `id` attribute is fx used to give several tags a common id. `class` is used to differentiate between different tags and provide them with different stylings. A common and useful attribute is `href` which contain the link that a hyperlink is refering to."
